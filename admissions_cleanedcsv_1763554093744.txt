It looks like you’re referring to a file named Admissions_Cleaned.csv — probably a cleaned dataset for an admissions-related project.
If you already have this file and want to load, inspect, or process it, here’s a complete Python example using pandas:
Pythonimport pandas as pd
import os

# Path to your CSV file
file_path = "Admissions_Cleaned.csv"

try:
    # Check if file exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {file_path}")

    # Load the CSV into a DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Display basic info
    print("\n--- Dataset Info ---")
    print(df.info())

    # Show first 5 rows
    print("\n--- First 5 Rows ---")
    print(df.head())

    # Check for missing values
    print("\n--- Missing Values ---")
    print(df.isnull().sum())

    # Basic statistics for numeric columns
    print("\n--- Summary Statistics ---")
    print(df.describe())

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)
except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
    print("The CSV file is empty.")
except pd.errors.ParserError:
    print("Error parsing the CSV file. Please check its format.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

What this script does:

Validates file existence before loading.
Reads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
Prints:

Dataset structure (info()).
First 5 rows (head()).
Missing value counts.
Summary statistics for numeric columns.


Handles common errors like missing file, empty file, or parsing issues.


If you don’t have the file yet, I can help you create a sample Admissions_Cleaned.csv with realistic columns (e.g., StudentID, Name, GPA, TestScore, AdmissionStatus) so you can test your code.
Do you want me to generate a sample admissions dataset for you?
